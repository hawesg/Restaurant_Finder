Both me and my roommate eat out a lot and are usually very indecisive about where to eat this is meant to help with that problem by outputting a list in random order of the restaurants that meet certain criteria. Originally my plan was to write an algorithm that wighted choices based on things like when we last ate there, our tendency to select one restaurant over anther, etc... But i underestimated the amount of time working with a language in which i had no real experience in. To manage restaurant or categories visit their respective admin sections. For ease in data entry there is the ability to enter restaurants by MenuPagesª url. The categories to the left are dynamically generated from the database. Feel free to add, remove, change any data you need to. I did not write any functional test for rails as i am not there yet learning wise. Please use the css validation link below as i have used some css 3 and you need to pass css3 to the validator via url.
